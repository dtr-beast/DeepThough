## DeepThought Task 1 - Event API Creation

### Brief

## Project setup

### Environment Variables

- These are optional, as I have provided default values for them.

`PORT: Server Port. DEFAULT: 3000`

`MONGODB_URI: URI of Mongo DB Server. DEFAULT: mongodb://localhost:27017/dt-task1`

### Starting up the project

- I have used [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/), but the project should run with NPM as well.

- To install PNPM

```shell
npm i -g pnpm
```
- Run via PNPM

```shell
pnpm install 
pnpm run dev
```
- Run via NPM

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```
